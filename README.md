## Overview  
<hr>

The purpose of this repo is to become familiarized with SQLAlchemy's Object Relational Mapper (ORM).  To do this I will be using a SQLite database that has two tables about Hawaii weather (measurements and stations).  The code associated with this project can be found in the analysis folder within a jupyter notebook named `climate_analysis.ipynb`. In addtion to analyzing the data, a Flask API was created that connects to the database and accepts five different API requests - three of the requests return a predefined query result but the other two API's allow for the user to include one or two user inputs that are used within the API request as database filters.

## Technologies
* Python
* Pandas
* SQLAlchemy
* Flask
* SQLite

<br>

## Data Source
Dataset generated by Trilogy Education Services. Origins beyond this is unknown.

## Setup and Installation  
1. Environment needs the following:  
    * Python 3.6+
    * pandas
    * flask
    * sqlalchemy.ext.automap
    * sqlalchemy.orm
    * datetime
    * numpy
1. Activate your environment
1. Clone the repo to your local machine
1. Start Jupyter Notebook within the environment from the repo
1. Run `climate_analysis.ipynb` to test connections and queries
1. To run the flask app:
    *  In terminal, navigate to the top-level repo folder
    *  Activate your environment
    *  In terminal run:  `python app.py`
    *  The routes that can be used are listed on the page.
